    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <div class="paragraph"><p>With a shared love for the universally coveted egg sandwich, husband/wife team Sarah Schneider and Demetri Makoulis alongside chef Nick Korbee opened the first Egg Shop outpost in 2014, in the Soho neighborhood of New York City. Inspired by the incredible versatility of the egg, the team went on to develop infinite egg-centric dishes that are both familiar and nuanced. Today, Korbee executes a seasonal menu of organic, locally sourced dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner at both their cozy SoHo location and more spacious outpost in Williamsburg, Brooklyn (opened in 2017) – paired with fresh juices, creative & refreshing cocktails, and a selection of organic and biodynamic wines. Eggheads everywhere can now recreate the restaurant’s signature bowls, sandwiches, and breakfast cocktails with Egg Shop: The Cookbook (released in 2017). Maintaining Egg Shop’s signature playful-yet-minimalist aesthetic, the book comically and thoroughly guides readers through all egg-cooking techniques and provides recipes for more than 100 inventive egg-centric dishes.</p>
